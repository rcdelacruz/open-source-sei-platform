# SEI Platform

Open Source Software Engineering Intelligence Platform

## Overview

The SEI Platform is an enterprise-grade, open-source solution for building Software Engineering Intelligence capabilities. It provides data-driven insights into engineering operations, team performance, and development lifecycle optimization.

## Key Features

### Core Analytics

- **DORA Metrics**: Deployment frequency, lead time, change failure rate, recovery time
- **Team Performance**: Velocity tracking, bottleneck identification, collaboration metrics
- **Code Quality**: Technical debt analysis, security vulnerability tracking
- **Predictive Analytics**: Risk prediction, capacity planning, timeline forecasting

### Integrations

- **Version Control**: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps
- **Project Management**: Jira, Azure Boards, Linear, Asana
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, Tekton
- **Communication**: Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord
- **Security**: Snyk, SonarQube, Veracode, Checkmarx

### Dashboards

- **Executive View**: High-level KPIs, ROI metrics, strategic insights
- **Engineering Manager**: Team performance, resource allocation, delivery tracking
- **Developer**: Personal productivity, code quality, review metrics
- **Product Manager**: Feature delivery, user impact, technical health

## Architecture

The platform is built on a modern microservices architecture:

- **Data Collection Layer**: API collectors and webhook handlers
- **Processing Layer**: Event streaming with Apache Kafka
- **Storage Layer**: TimescaleDB for time-series, PostgreSQL for metadata
- **Analytics Engine**: DORA metrics, ML models, custom analytics
- **API Gateway**: REST and GraphQL interfaces
- **Frontend**: React, Vue.js, and Next.js applications
