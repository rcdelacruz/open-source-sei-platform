# Contributing to Open Source SEI Platform

We love your input! We want to make contributing to the Open Source SEI Platform as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Quick Start for Contributors

```bash
# 1. Fork the repository
# 2. Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/open-source-sei-platform.git
cd open-source-sei-platform

# 3. Set up development environment
make quickstart

# 4. Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature

# 5. Make your changes and test
make test
make lint

# 6. Commit your changes
git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'

# 7. Push to your fork
git push origin feature/amazing-feature

# 8. Open a Pull Request
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** - Ensure any new features are documented
2. **Update tests** - Add tests for new functionality
3. **Follow code style** - Run `make format` and `make lint`
4. **Update changelog** - Add your changes to CHANGELOG.md
5. **Get reviews** - Ensure your PR is reviewed by maintainers

## Code Style Guidelines

### Python
- Follow PEP 8
- Use Black for formatting: `make format`
- Type hints are required for new code
- Docstrings required for public functions

### TypeScript/JavaScript
- Use Prettier for formatting
- Follow ESLint rules
- Prefer functional components in React

### Documentation
- Use Markdown for documentation
- Include mermaid diagrams where helpful
- Keep examples up to date

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test types
make test-unit
make test-integration
make test-e2e
```

### Writing Tests
- Unit tests for individual functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for user workflows
- Aim for >80% code coverage

## Issue Reporting

### Bug Reports
Use the bug report template and include:

- **Steps to reproduce**
- **Expected behavior**
- **Actual behavior**
- **Environment details**
- **Screenshots** (if applicable)

### Feature Requests
Use the feature request template and include:

- **Problem description**
- **Proposed solution**
- **Alternatives considered**
- **Use case scenarios**

## Architecture Guidelines

### Microservices
- Each service should have a single responsibility
- Use async communication where possible
- Implement proper error handling and retries
- Include health checks and metrics

### Database
- Use migrations for schema changes
- Follow normalization principles
- Index frequently queried columns
- Document schema changes

### API Design
- Follow RESTful principles
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Implement proper pagination
- Version your APIs

## Security

### Reporting Security Issues
**DO NOT** open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, email security@sei-platform.org with:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

### Security Guidelines
- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Validate all user inputs
- Use HTTPS for all communications

## Performance

### Guidelines
- Profile before optimizing
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Use database indexes appropriately
- Implement proper pagination
- Monitor resource usage

### Benchmarks
- API responses < 200ms (95th percentile)
- Database queries < 100ms
- Page load times < 3 seconds
- System uptime > 99.9%

## Documentation

### Types of Documentation
- **README.md** - Project overview and quick start
- **API docs** - Generated from code comments
- **Architecture docs** - High-level system design
- **User guides** - How to use the platform
- **Admin guides** - Deployment and configuration

### Documentation Standards
- Keep documentation close to code
- Update docs with code changes
- Use examples and diagrams
- Test documentation regularly

## Community Guidelines

### Code of Conduct
We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all.
