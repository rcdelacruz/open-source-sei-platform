**Phase 1 Focus**:

- Infrastructure components
- Basic data collectors
- Core database schema
- Initial API endpoints
- Simple dashboards

**Phase 2 Focus**:

- DORA metrics implementation
- Team performance analytics
- Advanced integrations
- Real-time processing

**Phase 3 Focus**:

- Machine learning models
- Predictive analytics
- Custom metrics framework
- Mobile applications

**Phase 4 Focus**:

- Documentation completion

### Finding Tasks

**1. Check the roadmap for current sprint**

Each phase breaks down into monthly and weekly deliverables. Look for:

- Unchecked items in current month
- Items marked as "help wanted"
- Tasks aligned with your expertise

**2. Review GitHub Issues**

Issues are tagged by phase and priority:

- `phase-1-foundation`
- `phase-2-core`
- `phase-3-advanced`
- `phase-4-enterprise`
- `good-first-issue`
- `help-wanted`

**3. Join planning discussions**

Participate in:

- Weekly sprint planning meetings
- Monthly phase review sessions
- GitHub Discussions for roadmap topics

## Proposing New Features

### Feature Proposal Process

To propose a feature not on the roadmap:

**1. Create a feature proposal issue**

Use the feature request template and include:

- Problem statement
- Proposed solution
- User stories
- Technical approach
- Estimated effort
- Alignment with project goals

**2. Discuss with maintainers**

Maintainers will evaluate based on:

- Alignment with platform vision
- Priority relative to roadmap items
- Resource availability
- Technical feasibility
- Community benefit

**3. Get approval before starting**

Wait for maintainer approval before investing significant effort.

**4. Update roadmap if approved**

Approved features are added to the appropriate phase.

### Feature Criteria

Features are more likely to be accepted if they:

- Solve a common engineering intelligence problem
- Align with DORA metrics and DevOps best practices
- Integrate well with existing architecture
- Can be implemented incrementally
- Have broad community benefit
- Include comprehensive tests and documentation

## Sprint Planning

### Sprint Structure

We operate in 2-week sprints:

**Week 1**: Development and review
**Week 2**: Testing and integration

### Sprint Participation

To participate in sprints:

**1. Attend sprint planning** (every other Monday)

- Review upcoming tasks
- Claim tasks you want to work on
- Discuss dependencies and blockers

**2. Daily check-ins** (async in Discord)

- What you completed yesterday
- What you're working on today
- Any blockers

**3. Sprint review** (Friday of week 2)

- Demo completed work
- Get feedback from team
- Identify improvements

## Roadmap Milestones

### Phase Milestones

Each phase has defined success criteria:

**Phase 1 Success Criteria**:

- 100+ developers tracked
- 5+ repositories integrated
- Basic DORA metrics displayed
- 99%+ system uptime
- Sub-5 second dashboard load times

**Phase 2 Success Criteria**:

- All 4 DORA metrics implemented
- 10+ integrations working
- Real-time alerts functioning
- 500+ developers tracked
- Sub-2 second query response times

**Phase 3 Success Criteria**:

- 5+ ML models in production
- Custom metrics framework live
- Mobile apps in app stores
- 1000+ API requests/minute
- 95%+ prediction accuracy

**Phase 4 Success Criteria**:

- Multi-tenant architecture deployed
- Enterprise security certified
- 10,000+ users supported
- Complete documentation available
- Active community established

### Contributing to Milestones

Help achieve milestones by:

- Implementing features toward success criteria
- Writing tests to ensure reliability
- Improving performance metrics
- Documenting capabilities
- Testing with realistic data

## Priority Areas

### High Priority (Always Needed)

- Bug fixes for existing features
- Performance optimizations
- Security improvements
- Test coverage increases
- Documentation updates

### Medium Priority (Phase Dependent)

- Features from current phase
- Integration improvements
- UI/UX enhancements
- API additions

### Low Priority (Future Phases)

- Features from future phases
- Experimental capabilities
- Nice-to-have improvements

## Technical Decisions

### Architecture Decision Records

Significant technical decisions are documented in ADRs.

**When to create an ADR**:

- Choosing between architectural approaches
- Adopting new technologies
- Changing core patterns
- Making breaking changes

**ADR Process**:

1. Create ADR draft in `docs/adr/`
2. Discuss in GitHub Discussions
3. Get maintainer approval
4. Implement decision
5. Update ADR with outcomes

### Technology Choices

The platform has established technology choices:

**Backend**: Python (FastAPI), Go (DORA engine)
**Frontend**: React, Vue.js, Next.js
**Data**: TimescaleDB, PostgreSQL, Redis
**Processing**: Apache Spark, Kafka
**Deployment**: Kubernetes, Docker

Proposing different technologies requires strong justification.
