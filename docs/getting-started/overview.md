# Overview

## What is SEI Platform?

The Software Engineering Intelligence (SEI) Platform is an open-source solution designed to provide comprehensive insights into software development operations, team performance, and engineering excellence.

## Purpose

Modern software teams need data-driven insights to:

- Measure and improve engineering productivity
- Track team performance objectively
- Identify bottlenecks in the development process
- Make informed decisions about resource allocation
- Demonstrate the impact of engineering investments

The SEI Platform addresses these needs by collecting, processing, and analyzing data from your existing development tools.

## Key Capabilities

### Data Collection

Automated collection from multiple sources:

- Version control systems (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
- Project management tools (Jira, Azure Boards, Linear)
- CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
- Communication platforms (Slack, Microsoft Teams)
- Security scanning tools (Snyk, SonarQube)

### Analytics

Comprehensive analytics across multiple dimensions:

- **DORA Metrics**: Industry-standard DevOps performance indicators
- **Team Velocity**: Sprint-over-sprint performance tracking
- **Code Quality**: Technical debt and quality trends
- **Developer Productivity**: Individual and team contributions
- **Predictive Insights**: ML-powered forecasting and risk detection

### Visualization

Multiple dashboard views for different roles:

- Executive dashboards for strategic decision-making
- Manager views for team performance and resource planning
- Developer portals for personal productivity insights
- Product manager views for delivery tracking

## Architecture Principles
