# Upcoming Work

This document outlines planned work for upcoming sprints and future phases of the SEI Platform.

## Current Sprint: 1.2 - Data Models & Database Layer

**Alembic Migrations**:

- [ ] Initialize Alembic configuration
- [ ] Create initial migration script
- [ ] Add TimescaleDB hypertable setup
- [ ] Create indexes for performance
- [ ] Add constraints and foreign keys
- [ ] Document migration process

**Repository Pattern**:

- [ ] Base repository with common CRUD operations
- [ ] Organization repository
- [ ] Team repository

### Risks and Mitigation

**Risk**: TimescaleDB specific features may require custom migration logic

- Mitigation: Research TimescaleDB best practices early
- Mitigation: Create helper functions for hypertable setup

**Risk**: Complex relationships may impact query performance

- Mitigation: Implement eager loading where needed
- Mitigation: Add database indexes strategically
